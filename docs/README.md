# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to OctoAcme's project management documentation hub! This guide provides an overview of our project management framework and links to detailed process documentation.

## Overview

OctoAcme's project management framework enables consistent and high-quality delivery of cross-functional projects. Core personas include Project Managers, Product Managers, Developers, QA/Testers, and Stakeholders, each with clearly defined responsibilities for planning, delivery, and validation. Scheduled rituals—standups, syncs, planning meetings, and retrospectives—ensure transparency and collaboration.

The process follows a structured lifecycle: Initiation (idea validation, stakeholder alignment, success criteria), Planning (scope, backlog, milestones, dependency management), Execution (project board tracking, PR workflows, demos), Release and Deployment (pre-release checklist, release notes, incident playbooks), and Retrospective/Continuous Improvement (learning, metrics, follow-ups). Each stage uses templates and checklists for clarity.

Communication strategies include weekly PM syncs, team standups, stakeholder updates, and formal escalation paths. Status is reported through dashboards, risk registers, and release notes. Quality assurance is integral, with automated and manual testing, security scans, and defined acceptance criteria. Velocity, burndown, and impact metrics further support continuous improvement.
